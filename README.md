# Boxes_Website
making a template that displays boxes in ASP

I have an AutoGrid in the helpers folder, as well as the beginnings of chat.

I'd like people to be able to post an ItemState with coordinates for where the box is in the view, then have the box display.

It's pretty far along.
Thanks for checking it out...
